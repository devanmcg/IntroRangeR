# Homework assignment

## Background 

Gerry Stokka, NDSU Animal Science, put these spikes in the noses of a few calves while they were still nursing on the range. 
The idea is that they poke mama's udder, she resists nursing, and the calves learn to find their own food, essentially self-weaning. 
Stokka's lab was curious how this affected their behavior once everyone was officially weaned and brought to the feedlot.
