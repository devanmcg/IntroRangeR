This is a public repository for my NDSU graduate seminar *Introduction to* ***R***. 
Fork or bookmark for most of the most recent course materials (homework solutions excluded!).

## Lectures on YouTube

Inspired by the Great Isolation of 2020, I've made several videos, [which are available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKXOvaXmjIGcSHFMe2Wpsaw4yzvWR0AgQ), that go through each script as if we were in the classroom. 

## Course objectives 

After working through this material, one should have a better-than-beginner proficiency in **R** for the purposes of data management, analysis, and presentation. 

One won't learn to do everything one needs for a thesis or report, but one will have the foundation in **R** programming and operation so as to effectively seek help for the specific tasks one needs. 

The course focuses on using the `tidyverse` for data manipulation, with the primary intent of helping users get their data out of spreadsheet programs and doing as much of their data management as possible in the **R** environment. 

## Required software 

These materials assume one has **R** and **RStudio** installed on their computer. 
Both are freely available.

## History 

The initial commit was pretty much as the course was at the end of the first run, in spring 2018. 
2020 has seen substantial reorganization and addition of content.
