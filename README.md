# IntroRangeR
 
This is a public repository for my NDSU graduate seminar *Introduction to ***R***. 
Fork or bookmark for most of the most recent course materials (homework solutions excluded!).

## History 

The initial commit was pretty much as the course was at the end of the first run, in spring 2018. 
Expect substantial changes in Spring 2020, especially to the order of weekly material.
