## 11.1: Cluster analysis

Since I began teaching multivariate analyses--at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, in 2014--I've had a few students from each class submit to having several 'traits' measured and recorded. 
We use the dataset to demonstrate multivariate techniques in class. 
You will use those data, [StudentsLong.csv](https://github.com/devanmcg/IntroRangeR/raw/master/data/StudentsLong.csv) for this assignment. 

Ensure all script is included at the end of your document as an appendix. 

* Load the data and ensure it is in the proper format for multivariate analysis. 
* Present a scatterplot matrix. 
Refer to it in answering this question: *What do the axes of the variables suggest you ought to do to the data prior to conducting a multivariate analysis?*
* Present a cluster diagram based on a Euclidean distance matrix.
* Conduct a k-means clustering test and present the results graphically. 
Refer to it in answering this question: *What is the optimal number of groups for the student trait dataset?*
* Re-plot the cluster diagram with the optimal number of groups identified.
