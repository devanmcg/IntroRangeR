## Homework assignment 

Take baby steps into using R markdown. 
Open a new R markdown file and modify it. 
Minimum modifications for this assignment include:

    * All-new text
    * *str()* on a modified version of *mtcars*
    * Make the following graph, based on having made the necessary modification to *mtcars*: 

Steps:
    * Open a new R markdown file. 
    - In R studio, go *File > New file... > R markdown*
    - Enter a title like "My first R markdown file", your name, and select MS Word.
    * Modify the text and R script
     - The grey areas that start with ```{r} and end with ``` are the code chunks. 
     Anything in there is read as R script as if you were sending it to the console.
     - Anything outside the chunks is read as regular text. 
     - In the chunk, a line that starts with # is a comment (it is R code, remember?)
     - Outside the chunk, a line that starts with # is made Heading Level 1 (## = Heading Level 2, ###=Heading Level 3, etc)
    * knit into a Word document with the *Knit* button.
    * Save the Word document and upload here to complete the assignment.
