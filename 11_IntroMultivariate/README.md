# Homework 

Since I began teaching multivariate analyses -- at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, in 2014 -- I've had a few students from each class submit to having several 'traits' measured and recorded. 
We use the dataset to demonstrate multivariate techniques in class. 
You will use [these data] for this homework assignment.
